          baptism, His works, His teachings, His crucifixion, His millennial
          reign, His White Throne Judgment, and the New Heavens and the New

          Church) as well as the Nine-fold Fruit of the Spirit.
          <br />
          <strong>8.</strong> Strong Church government under the leadership of
          the Local Pastor with the other four fold ministries contributing to
          prepare the members of the Church for the work of the Ministry
          (Service), for the building up of the Church towards the attainment of
          unity in the faith and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Son of
          God and for the maturity of the Church to the full measure of the
          fullness of Christ.
          <br />
          <strong>9.</strong> The possibility of falling from grace.
